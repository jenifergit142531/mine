What is Workflow?
A workflow is a series of activities involved in a task or set of activities collectively forms a work. 
Except for the first and last step, steps will have a preceding and succeeding step.

What is Activity?

An activity defines a piece of work. 
The work an activity implements can be very simple or it can be quite complex. 
Activities are the fundamental building blocks or unit of a workflow.
An activity represents an action in a workflow. 

Rules and Conditions

Conditions are logic that return true or false. 
A number of Work Flow activities work based on conditions by affecting their behavior. 
These activities include the While activity, the IfElseBranch activity, and the ConditionedActivityGroup. 

Rules contains various conditions with a set of actions to perform. 
Rules use a declarative if-then-else style, where the "if" is a condition to evaluate.


Types:

- flowchart
- state
